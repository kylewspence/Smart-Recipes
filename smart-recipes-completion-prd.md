# Smart Recipes - Implementation Completion PRD
**Product Requirements Document for Finalizing Core Features**

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive system audit conducted on January 4, 2025, Smart Recipes is approximately **55% complete** with significant gaps in core functionality. While the foundation (authentication, database, security) is solid, critical user-facing features are either missing or broken.

**Key Finding**: Many tasks are marked "done" in the task management system, but actual implementation is incomplete or non-functional.

## Current Status Assessment

### ✅ **Working Systems (55%)**
- **Authentication**: Registration, login (with rate limiting)
- **Database**: Healthy connections, migrations, pool management
- **Security**: Input validation, XSS protection, security headers
- **Privacy**: GDPR compliance endpoints, cookie consent
- **Infrastructure**: Error handling, logging, monitoring
- **Basic User Management**: User creation, profile retrieval

### ❌ **Broken/Missing Systems (45%)**
- **User Preferences**: All CRUD operations (404 errors)
- **Recipe Generation**: Fails due to missing preferences
- **Recipe Search**: 500 server errors
- **Unified Search**: 404 not found
- **Recommendations**: 404 not found  
- **Ingredient Search**: 500 server errors
- **Frontend Features**: Many buttons/forms not functional

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. **API Route Mapping Issues**
**Problem**: Server routes exist but are not properly mounted
- `/api/preferences/*` returns 404 "endpoint not found"
- `/api/search/unified` returns 404 
- `/api/recommendations/*` returns 404

**Impact**: Core user flows completely broken

### 2. **Database Query Errors**
**Problem**: 500 errors in search functionality
- Recipe search throws "unexpected error"
- Ingredient search fails with server errors

**Impact**: Users cannot find existing content

### 3. **Missing Dependency Chain**
**Problem**: Recipe generation requires preferences, but preferences API is broken
**Impact**: Primary app feature (AI recipe generation) is non-functional

### 4. **Frontend-Backend Disconnect**
**Problem**: Frontend components call endpoints that don't exist or return wrong data formats
**Impact**: UI shows loading states, errors, or "NaN" values
