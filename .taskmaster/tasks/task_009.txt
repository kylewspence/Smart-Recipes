# Task ID: 9
# Title: Advanced Search & Filtering System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive search and filtering for recipes with AI-powered recommendations
# Details:
Build advanced search and filtering capabilities for recipes including full-text search, ingredient-based search, complex filters, and AI-powered recipe recommendations.

## ðŸ§­ ANTI-DRIFT REMINDERS:
- **ALWAYS review previous work**: Before starting, examine completed tasks 1-5 to understand established patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions
- **Maintain consistency**: Follow the same coding style, naming conventions, file structure, and patterns already established in the project
- **Check integration points**: Ensure your work integrates seamlessly with existing authentication, database, API, and frontend systems
- **Review project context**: Reference the Smart Recipes PRD, tech stack (Next.js, Express, PostgreSQL, OpenAI), and overall goals regularly
- **Validate against completed work**: Compare your implementation with similar completed features to ensure consistency

## ðŸ§¹ CLEAN CODE PRINCIPLES:
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reuse existing utilities, components, types, and logic wherever possible
  - Check client/lib/, client/components/ui/, server/lib/ for existing implementations
  - Review server/types/, client/lib/types/ for type definitions
  - Examine server/middleware/, client/lib/services/ for reusable patterns
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, component, and module should have one clear purpose
- **Modular Architecture**: Build reusable, maintainable pieces that can be easily tested and extended
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established patterns for:
  - Error handling (server/lib/error-middleware.ts, client/lib/services/)
  - Validation (server/schemas/, Zod patterns)
  - API responses (server/routes/ patterns)
  - Component structure (client/components/ patterns)
- **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript usage with proper interfaces and type definitions
- **Performance First**: Consider performance implications and optimize for production use
- **Security Minded**: Always consider security implications and follow established security patterns

## ðŸ”§ REUSABILITY CHECKLIST:
- Can this logic be abstracted into a reusable utility?
- Does this component follow the established design system (shadcn/ui + Tailwind)?
- Are there existing similar implementations I can extend?
- Will this integration work with existing authentication/authorization?
- Does this follow the same error handling patterns?
- Is this compatible with existing state management?

## ðŸ“‹ INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Must work with existing AuthContext (client/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx)
- Follow established API patterns (server/routes/)
- Use existing validation schemas (server/schemas/)
- Integrate with current database schema (database/schema.sql)
- Maintain compatibility with existing UI components (client/components/)
