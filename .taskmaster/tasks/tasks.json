            "details": "Build searchable knowledge base, create training materials for new team members, document best practices, and establish documentation maintenance procedures.\n\n## 🧭 ANTI-DRIFT REMINDERS:\n- **ALWAYS review previous work**: Before starting, examine completed tasks 1-5 to understand established patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions\n- **Maintain consistency**: Follow the same coding style, naming conventions, file structure, and patterns already established in the project\n- **Check integration points**: Ensure your work integrates seamlessly with existing authentication, database, API, and frontend systems\n- **Review project context**: Reference the Smart Recipes PRD, tech stack (Next.js, Express, PostgreSQL, OpenAI), and overall goals regularly\n- **Validate against completed work**: Compare your implementation with similar completed features to ensure consistency\n\n## 🧹 CLEAN CODE PRINCIPLES:\n- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reuse existing utilities, components, types, and logic wherever possible\n  - Check client/lib/, client/components/ui/, server/lib/ for existing implementations\n  - Review server/types/, client/lib/types/ for type definitions\n  - Examine server/middleware/, client/lib/services/ for reusable patterns\n- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, component, and module should have one clear purpose\n- **Modular Architecture**: Build reusable, maintainable pieces that can be easily tested and extended\n- **Consistent Patterns**: Follow established patterns for:\n  - Error handling (server/lib/error-middleware.ts, client/lib/services/)\n  - Validation (server/schemas/, Zod patterns)\n  - API responses (server/routes/ patterns)\n  - Component structure (client/components/ patterns)\n- **Type Safety**: Maintain strict TypeScript usage with proper interfaces and type definitions\n- **Performance First**: Consider performance implications and optimize for production use\n- **Security Minded**: Always consider security implications and follow established security patterns\n\n## 🔧 REUSABILITY CHECKLIST:\n- Can this logic be abstracted into a reusable utility?\n- Does this component follow the established design system (shadcn/ui + Tailwind)?\n- Are there existing similar implementations I can extend?\n- Will this integration work with existing authentication/authorization?\n- Does this follow the same error handling patterns?\n- Is this compatible with existing state management?\n\n## 📋 INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:\n- Must work with existing AuthContext (client/lib/contexts/AuthContext.tsx)\n- Follow established API patterns (server/routes/)\n- Use existing validation schemas (server/schemas/)\n- Integrate with current database schema (database/schema.sql)\n- Maintain compatibility with existing UI components (client/components/)",
