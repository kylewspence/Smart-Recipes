# Smart Recipes API Critical Issues Resolution PRD

## Project Overview
Based on comprehensive system audit, Smart Recipes has critical infrastructure issues preventing core functionality. This PRD addresses systematic fixes to restore full API functionality and database integration.

## Current State Analysis
**Audit Results:** 14/34 tests passing (41.2% success rate)

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Database Schema Missing:** Analytics tables don't exist
2. **Route Mounting Issues:** Several API routes not properly mounted
3. **Database Query Errors:** 500 errors across all major endpoints
4. **Missing Search Functionality:** Advanced search completely broken
5. **User Preferences System:** Conflicts between POST/PUT operations
6. **Recipe Generation:** OpenAI integration failing
7. **Ingredients System:** Database queries failing
8. **Recommendations Engine:** Routes not found
9. **Analytics System:** Missing database tables
10. **GDPR Compliance:** Data export failing

## Success Criteria
- **100% API endpoint functionality**
- **All database queries working**
- **Full test suite passing**
- **Recipe generation operational**
- **Search functionality restored**
- **User preferences system working**
- **Analytics tracking functional**
- **GDPR compliance operational**

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Database Schema Fixes
**Priority: Critical**
- Create missing analytics tables (analytics_events, analytics_pageviews, analytics_performance)
- Fix ingredient categorization queries
- Resolve recipe database structure issues
- Add missing indexes for search functionality
- Verify all foreign key relationships

### Phase 2: API Route Resolution
**Priority: Critical**
- Debug and fix all 500 Internal Server Error responses
- Verify route mounting in server.ts
- Fix ingredients endpoint database queries
- Resolve recipes endpoint database issues
- Fix search endpoint query problems
- Restore recommendations functionality

### Phase 3: User Preferences System
**Priority: High**
- Fix POST/PUT conflict in preferences creation
- Ensure preferences are properly saved and retrieved
- Validate preference data persistence
- Test preference updates and modifications

### Phase 4: Recipe Generation System
**Priority: High**
- Debug OpenAI integration failures
- Fix recipe generation endpoint
- Ensure recipe saving to database works
- Test recipe favoriting/unfavoriting
- Verify recipe substitutions functionality

### Phase 5: Search Functionality
**Priority: High**
- Fix basic recipe search queries
- Restore advanced search with filters
- Fix ingredient-based search
- Ensure search analytics logging works
- Test search performance optimization

### Phase 6: Analytics and Monitoring
**Priority: Medium**
- Create analytics database tables
- Fix analytics event logging
- Restore analytics health checks
- Implement analytics summary endpoints
- Test performance monitoring

### Phase 7: Security and Compliance
**Priority: Medium**
- Fix GDPR data export functionality
- Ensure privacy policy endpoints work
- Test cookie consent system
- Validate security monitoring
- Verify rate limiting functionality

### Phase 8: Testing and Validation
**Priority: High**
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Validate all endpoints return expected data
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Performance testing under load
- Security penetration testing

## Implementation Strategy

### Database First Approach
1. Create all missing database tables and schemas
2. Run migrations to ensure database consistency
3. Verify all foreign key relationships
4. Add necessary indexes for performance

### Route-by-Route Debugging
1. Test each API endpoint individually
2. Fix database queries causing 500 errors
3. Verify proper error handling
4. Test authentication and authorization

### Integration Testing
1. Test full user workflows
2. Verify recipe generation to consumption pipeline
3. Test search and recommendation flows
4. Validate analytics data collection

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Database corruption during schema updates
- **Medium Risk:** Breaking existing functionality during fixes
- **Low Risk:** Performance degradation during optimization

## Timeline
- **Phase 1-2:** 2-3 days (Critical fixes)
- **Phase 3-5:** 3-4 days (Core functionality)
- **Phase 6-7:** 2-3 days (Supporting systems)
- **Phase 8:** 1-2 days (Testing and validation)

**Total Estimated Timeline:** 8-12 days

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 34 audit tests passing (100% success rate)
- [ ] Recipe generation working end-to-end
- [ ] Search functionality fully operational
- [ ] User preferences saving and loading correctly
- [ ] Analytics system collecting data
