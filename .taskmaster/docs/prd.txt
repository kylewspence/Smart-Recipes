# Smart Recipes - AI-Powered Meal Planner PRD

## Overview
Smart Recipes is a full-stack AI-powered meal planning application designed specifically for picky eaters who need personalized recipe suggestions. The app leverages OpenAI's GPT API to generate customized recipes based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, available ingredients, and "stretch" preferences (ingredients users are willing to try). This project serves as a senior capstone demonstrating modern full-stack development practices with robust data validation and AI integration.
