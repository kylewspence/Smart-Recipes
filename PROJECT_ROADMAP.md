#### 2.2 TypeScript Types ‚úÖ
Create `server/types/index.ts`:
- [x] User interface
- [x] UserPreferences interface
- [x] Recipe interface
- [x] API response types

**Checkpoint:** ‚úÖ All tables created, types defined

---

### Phase 3: Data Validation & Core API Setup (Start Here)
**Estimated Time: 2-3 days**

#### 3.1 Zod Schema Setup
- [ ] Install Zod: `npm install zod`
- [ ] Create `server/schemas/` directory
- [ ] Define Zod schemas for:
  - [ ] User creation/update
  - [ ] User preferences
  - [ ] Recipe data
  - [ ] **OpenAI response validation** (critical for reliable AI integration)
- [ ] Create validation middleware for API endpoints

#### 3.2 User Management API
```
POST /api/users              # Create user (with Zod validation)
GET /api/users/:id           # Get user
PUT /api/users/:id           # Update user (with Zod validation)
DELETE /api/users/:id        # Delete user
```

#### 3.3 User Preferences API
```
GET /api/users/:id/preferences     # Get user preferences
POST /api/users/:id/preferences    # Create/update preferences (with Zod validation)
```

**Checkpoint:** ‚úÖ Basic CRUD operations working with proper validation

  const OpenAIRecipeSchema = z.object({
    title: z.string(),
    description: z.string().optional(),
    ingredients: z.array(z.string()),
    instructions: z.string(),
    cookingTime: z.number().optional(),
    // ... etc
  })
  ```

#### 4.4 Recipe API
```
GET /api/users/:id/recipes         # Get user's saved recipes
POST /api/users/:id/recipes        # Save a recipe (with Zod validation)
PUT /api/recipes/:id               # Update recipe (add notes, etc.)
DELETE /api/recipes/:id            # Delete recipe

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Backend-First Approach (Recommended)
1. **Build API endpoints with validation** ‚Üí Test with Postman/curl
2. **Add authentication** ‚Üí Test protected routes
3. **Integrate OpenAI with robust validation** ‚Üí Test recipe generation
4. **Build frontend** ‚Üí Connect to working API

### Benefits:
- Solid foundation before UI work
- Easy to test and debug
- Clear separation of concerns
- **Reliable data flow with validation**
- Can build frontend knowing API works

---

## üîç Zod Integration Strategy

### Why Zod is Critical for This Project:
- **OpenAI responses can be unpredictable** - Zod ensures data consistency
- **User input validation** - Prevent bad data from reaching database
- **Type safety** - Runtime validation matches TypeScript types
- **Better error messages** - Clear feedback for users and debugging

### Where to Use Zod:
1. **API request/response validation** (all endpoints)
2. **OpenAI response parsing** (most critical)
3. **Form validation** (frontend)
4. **Database input sanitization**

### Implementation Order:
1. **Phase 3**: Basic API validation
2. **Phase 4**: OpenAI response validation (highest priority)
3. **Phase 6**: Frontend form validation
4. **Throughout**: Refine and add validation as needed
